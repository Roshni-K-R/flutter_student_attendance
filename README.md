Student Attendence App which allow to mark student attendence by selecting the class and section.
The Student Attendance App is a mobile application designed to streamline attendance management for educators by allowing attendance marking by class and section. Using the Flutter framework and the Provider package for state management, this app simplifies classroom attendance by displaying classes and sections in selectable lists. Teachers can select a class and section, and mark students as present or absent with just a few taps, updating the attendance status efficiently. The use of Provider ensures that app-wide state, such as the attendance records and user inputs, is seamlessly managed and responsive across the interface.

Class and Section Selection: The app allows teachers to choose specific classes and sections from a list, providing a structured approach to attendance.
User Interface (UI): The UI is designed for simplicity and efficiency, enabling teachers to quickly navigate between classes and mark attendance without unnecessary steps.
Attendance Marking: Once a class and section are selected, the app displays a list of students for that section. Teachers can mark each student as present or absent with a single tap.
Real-Time Updates: The use of the Provider package as a state management solution ensures real-time updates to the UI as attendance is marked, improving responsiveness and user experience.
This project aims to enhance accuracy and reduce the administrative workload associated with attendance tracking.
